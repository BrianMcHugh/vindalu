Roadmap
--------

These are features that still need to be added (not necessarily in this order):

* Role based access control on resource types.
* Resource type linking.
* `type` metadata
* Batch writes.
* Token revocation
* Formatted responses (e.g. csv, xml, msgpack)
* Pluggable config parameter reader for external sources such as consul and vault.
* Index snapshotting.
